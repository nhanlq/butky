Step 1 ---

Upload folder "admin-panel" to the directory of the themed designed by go1

Step 2 ---


Create a new page and ensure the URL path to this node is "admin-panel"

Copy and paste the following code into the Body section:

Step 3 ---

Update the .info file and add:

stylesheets[all][] = admin-panel/admin-panel.css

And add the following region:

regions[admin_panel_links] = Admin Panel Links ONLY

Step 4 ---

Update the page.tpl.php file and add:

  <?php // ADMIN PANEL LINKS ?>
  <div id="admin-panel-links"><?php print $admin_panel_links; ?></div>
  <?php // END ADMIN PANEL LINKS ?>
  
  Make sure this is placed just outside the body tag - ensure the above snippet is not nested within any <div> tags, as we will use CSS to position:absolute; the #admin-panel-links div.
  
Step 5 ---

Create a new drupal block called "Admin Panel Links" and add the following HTML:

<ul>
<li class="return"><a href="/admin-panel">Return to the Administration Panel</a></li>
<li class="logout"><a href="/logout">Logout</a></li>
</ul>

Step 6 ---

Assign the newly created block to the "Admin Panel Links ONLY" content region.



And you're DONE!!! :)
